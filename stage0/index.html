        <h2>About me</h2>
        <div class="line line2"></div>
        <p>I'm an aspiring node backend developer. My first backend project was a website called Locate event used to locate events 
            based on the user's input. I used express js, html, css and google's event api to bring out the list of events. It was difficult because it was my first time creating a website with express js
             and incorporating an api. I got help from other developers, ai and youtube to debug my code and make it work. But then i had difficulties 
             in hosting the website on vercel because it's known for mostly hosting frontend applications not backend. I had to research and ask on twitter before i could 
             get the solution. I created a vercel file and pasted the code i saw on an article for it to work.
             I joined <a href="https://hng.tech/internship">HNG</a> internship to build myself as a backend developer and surround myself with people in that field. I have some of my friends who joined the program last year and 
              i was adviced to join this year because it is a very good opportunity for people in tech. I'm thrilled to be apart of this programme. Not only will i be able to have more knowledge and experience 
              but i can get a certificate if i pay for the <a href="https://hng.tech/premium">premium</a> package which is as low as <span class="price">‚Ç¶5000</span>. I'm looking forward to what HNG has in store for me.
